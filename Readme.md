This is a simple web app, I started to get more familiar with __node JS and express JS__.
It is just a simple __Instagram__ like app which offers you to follow people and post Images.

Now it is under construction and heavy changes occur frequently.  So if you are cloning so keep and eye on new commits as they come frequently.

### How to get started
- Install Node JS
- Clone this repo by `git clone https://www.githyb.com/jztsaurabh/Ngram.git` or the __clone button__ on Github.
- Fork this and make your own changes.

### How can you use it
You can use it as you want but you have to give me __@itsjzt__ proper credits and a link to this repo.
